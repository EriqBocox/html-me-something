                    <h2>Disney World</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most families can say that they have vacationed to Disney World at Orlando Florida, so it's no surprise this makes the list. The was the first major spot I have ever been to for a vaction and is a great place for the whole to have a great time. It's even better when you get to go for your senior trip, with all your friends.

                    <p>
                        Ocean City Maryland is a very nolstalgic vacation for me. It's isnt really anywhere special when compared to other beaches along the east coast, but for me it holds a special place. I have many fond memories of crabbing with my dad and brother, and even just collecting Yu-Gi-Oh cards or walking down the boardwalk.

                    <h2>Ensenada, Mexico</h2>
                    <p>
                        My wife and I went on a Carnival cruise where the main stop was Ensenada, Mexico. Now the ship was the oldest in the fleet but the staff made it an incredible trip. When we arrived in Ensenada we booked a horseback riding trip through the mountains which was incredible and ended the day there with a lobster dinner and some tacos. Im pretty sure the workers there ripped us off with the price, but so what the dinner was worth it and it's an experience my wife and I will have forever.

                    <h2>Catalina Island</h2>
                    <p>
                        Catalina Island was actually apart of the same cruise mentioned in the <a href="#Mexico">Ensenada section</a>. Catalina is an island in California right off the cost. Its hands down one of the most beautiful and incredible places to live. In the summer the island is riddled with celebrities. Unfortunatly I wasnt there at peak season to experience that, but it was still warm enough to go on an incredible kayak trip down its cost. <b>Fun Fact: Catalina only allows so many cars on the island, you actually have to go on a waitlist that can take up to 30 years before it reaches you.</b>

                    <h2>The Bahamas</h2>
                    <p>
                        This trip was originally booked for Bermuda on our Honeymoon, but there was a hurricane at the same time so to avoid it, they took us to Princess Cay Island in the Bahamas. Once we got on the island I signed to get some snorkling gear, and seen some of the most incredible fish in the most beautiful clear blue water. After that we took a kayak trip, where we found our love for kayaking. you may have noticed in the <a href="#Catalina">Catalina section</a> that we also went kayaking there.
